    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "\n",
    " * The programm can be configured if there shall be additional debug output, if the test pictures in the specific folder shall be annoted and finally if the raw hough lines shall be shown or the extrapolated lines. To do this, please modify the parameters in the configuration area at the beginning of the code.\n",

    " * Convert the picture (frame) into a gray colored one. At this step a first filter is used bei only showing regions  in the range between 196 and 255.\n",
    " * Use a Gausssian-Blur on the gray image with kernel-size 5 (because this has shown the best results)\n",
    " * Apply the Canny-algorithm with a low-threshold of 100 and a high-threshold of 200\n",
    " * Apply a region of interest to mask out everything what is outside of the actual used driving lane. The size of the region is automatically adjusted to the size of the picture (frame)\n",
    " * Do a hough transformation with the following parameters: rho = 1, theta = np.pi/180, threshold = 15,    min_line_length = 20 and max_line_gap = 10\n",

    " * Starting values for x/y-values depending on framesize\n",
    " * Region of interest depending on framesize\n",
    " \n",
    "* Shortcomings\n",
    " * Annotated lines are still fluttering especially when the road is gray (in different shades)\n",
    " \n",
    "* Further improvements\n",
    " * Use transformation into HSV-Color-Space and apply filtering for yellow and white segments. This was working quite well for yellow lines, but not for white (light-gray) ones.\n",
    " * Optimize the parameters all over the pipeline\n",
    " * Check the solutions with further training/test data.\n",
    " * Do not directly use global variables for connecting the data from two frames, because this is not a good programming style (write access form inside a function).\n",
